This is a toolkits design by python, including ocr.py and pdf2image.py.

you can put you images which containing ocr text into 'images' folder, then run as :

```
python ocr.py
```

then, you will get the text on images in a ''.txt' file named by corresponding image name.

**TIPS**

you should get you own API_KEY and SECRET_KEY from baidu ai studio

if you want to get image from pdf file you can put your pdf files into 'pdfs'  folder then  run as:

```
python pdf2img.py
```
